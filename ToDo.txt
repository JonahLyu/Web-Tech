Little To-Do list that can be added to or taken from:
-Look into helmet.js middleware, recommended to be used with express for security reasons
-Look into measures to sanitise all user input and prevent injection of malicious code via comments, posts, user details, etc. (Escape html chars, prevent xss)
-Adjust styling of user settings page and new category page
-Add error handling (Try catches to routes users and forums redirects and such)
-Update site design
-Post svg icons (hover fill animations?)
-New banner image
-Limit posts/categories to X per page, add navigation to llok at first 1-5 5-10 etc.

(For some weird reason all of my commits have been under the wrong user name :/ I've just changed it)
