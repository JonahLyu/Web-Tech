Little To-Do list that can be added to or taken from:
-Add error handling (Try catches to routes users and forums redirects and such)
-Post svg icons (hover fill animations?)
-New banner image
-Limit posts/categories to X per page, add navigation to llok at first 1-5 5-10 etc.
-Make sure generated html validates
-Remove onclick from all remaining pages
-Move scripts to header
-https ssl
-Add script to only run 8000 port server

(For some weird reason all of my commits have been under the wrong user name :/ I've just changed it)
