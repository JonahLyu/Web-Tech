Little To-Do list that can be added to or taken from:
-Look into helmet.js middleware, recommended to be used with express for security reasons
-Look into measures to sanitise all user input and prevent injection of malicious code via comments, posts, user details, etc. (Escape html chars, prevent xss)
-Add ability for admins to update settings of another user
-Find a way to add delete buttons to comments, based on if current user posted comment, and if user is moderator or above
-Comments not being removed from database when post deleted, need to delete all the way down
-Trying to delete post while on page doesn't work
