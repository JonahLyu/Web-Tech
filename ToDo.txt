Little To-Do list that can be added to or taken from:
-Look into helmet.js middleware, recommended to be used with express for security reasons
-Look into measures to sanitise all user input and prevent injection of malicious code via comments, posts, user details, etc. (Escape html chars, prevent xss)
-Adjust styling of user settings page
-Add delete user function (Delete from auth0 also)
-Add error handling
-Update site design

(For some weird reason all of my commits have been under the wrong user name :/ I've just changed it)
